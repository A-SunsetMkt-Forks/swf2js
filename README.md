This version of swf2js is an adaption based on swf2js.js version 0.7.24 from
[https://github.com/ienaga/swf2js](https://github.com/ienaga/swf2js)

swf2js.min.js is the minified version created with [Google Closure Compiler)(https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler).

Added support for sounds and soundstreams

-   Sounds : mp3, raw (wave), ADPCM, NellyMoser.
-   Soundstreams : mp3, raw (wave), ADPCM.

Warning : no support for [Actionscript 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) which is introduced in Flash Player 9 (initially called 8.5).

Newer swf-files (version 9 and up) will probably still work, if you didn't useActionscript 3

If you have (or can find) Flash MX 2004 or Flash (Professional) 8, you can stil create sfw-files and use them with swf2js.js

[Known problems](#Known_problems)
==============

-   More than one swf-file in a page does not work properly.
-   Obviously Adobe FlashPlayer knows the exact frame size, even if
    bigger than the specified framesize in the header. \
    See examples : mogura and PlayPauseStop5
-   Video (mp4 and flv) not supported.
